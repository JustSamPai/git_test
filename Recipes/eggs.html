                Combine the salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, 
                and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the eggs one at a time, 
                being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil,
                and cook for 14 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, 
                    and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. 
                    Cool completely,about 15 minutes. 
                    Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.
